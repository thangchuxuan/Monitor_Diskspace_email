Shell script to watch the disk space and send an email alert
The df command under Linux displays the amount of disk space available on the file system containing each file name argument. Without any command-line argument, the df lists space available on all currently mounted Linux file systems. Let us see how to send an email alert when you run out of disk space by setting up 90% as the threshold.

Linux shell script to send an alert email if disk usage exceeds 90%
The steps are as follows:
(a) First, find disk space usage using the df command.
(b) Then filter out filesystem and find out the percentage of space using the grep command or egrep command.
(c) Write a shell script to watch the disk space and send an email.

Step # 1: First get disk space:

Open the terminal application and type the df command (no need to use the du command) to check free disk space on your Linux or Unix server. For example:
df -H

The -H option show sizes in powers of 1000 as follows:

Filesystem             Size   Used  Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hdb1               20G    14G   5.5G  71% /
tmpfs                  394M   4.1k   394M   1% /dev/shm
/dev/hdb5               29G    27G   654M  98% /nas/www

Step # 2: Next filter out filesystem and find out the percentage of space
We don‚Äôt want unwanted file systems. For example, NFS mounted or CD/DVD ROM or loopback devices. So how do you filter out the results? use the grep command or egerp command as follows:
df -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom' | awk '{ print $5 " " $1 }'
df -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom|loop|udev' | awk '{ print $5 " " $1 }'

Now we get desired outputs with for disk usage in percentage as follows:


71% /dev/hdb1
98% /dev/hdb5
Let us break down the df -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom' | awk '{ print $5 " " $1 }' command:

First, you run the df command with the -H option to get a human-readable output on your screen.
Next, you use the grep command to filter out the lines that start with the following strings: Filesystem, tmpfs, and cdrom. In other words, you only need a real block disk/device and filter out the rest of the outputs.
Finally, you use the awk command to display the fifth and first columns of the output. The fifth column is the percentage of disk space used, and the first column is the mount point.
Prerequisite
By default, mail command may not be installed on your system. Hence, use the apk command on Alpine Linux, dnf command/yum command on RHEL & co, apt command/apt-get command on Debian, Ubuntu & co, zypper command on SUSE/OpenSUSE, pacman command on Arch Linux to install the mail.

Step # 3: Write a shell script
So far, so good. The above Linux command displays fields 5 and 1 of the df command. Now all you need to do is write a script to see if the percentage of space is >= 90%. In other words, the following shell script will send an alert email alert if disk usage exceeds 90%.
#!/bin/sh
# Purpose: Monitor Linux disk space and send an email alert to $ADMIN
ALERT=90 # alert level 
ADMIN="you@cyberciti-biz" # dev/sysadmin email ID
df -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom' | awk '{ print $5 " " $1 }' | while read -r output;
do
  echo "$output"
  usep=$(echo "$output" | awk '{ print $1}' | cut -d'%' -f1 )
  partition=$(echo "$output" | awk '{ print $2 }' )
  if [ $usep -ge $ALERT ]; then
    echo "Running out of space \"$partition ($usep%)\" on $(hostname) as on $(date)" |
    mail -s "Alert: Almost out of disk space $usep%" "$ADMIN"
  fi
done
Here is how to install the mail command on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux using the apt-get command or apt command:
sudo apt install mailutils

For RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/Oracle/Alma or Fedora Linux try the yum command or dnf command to install the mail command:
sudo dnf install mailx

Make sure your system can route outgoing email. You can route (send) email using Gmail account with help of msmtp or ssmtp.
Step # 4: Setup a Cron job

Save and install the script using a cronjob. Copy script to /etc/cron.daily/ using the cp command (script downolad link):
cp diskAlert /etc/cron.daily/

Set up permission using the chmod command. For example:
chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/diskAlert

Once placed in the /etc/cron.daily/ directory, the diskAlert script will run daily on Linux systems. This ensures that important maintenance tasks, like monitoring disk space, are performed regularly by the sysadmin, preventing any potential issues. That‚Äôs all there is to it.

Installing cron job
Of course, you install it as cronjob using the crontab command too. For example, this is useful when you do not wish to use the /etc/cron.daily/ directory:
crontab -e

Write cronjob as per your requirement. For example:
10 0 * * * /path/to/diskAlert

OR
@daily /path/to/diskAlert

An updated script version to watch the disk space and send email alert
Tony contributed and updated my script ‚Äì You can exclude selected filesystem in case you don‚Äôt want monitor all filesystems.
#!/bin/sh
# set -x
# Shell script to monitor or watch the disk space
# It will send an email to $ADMIN, if the (free available) percentage of space is >= 90%.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set admin email so that you can get email.
ADMIN="root"
# set alert level 90% is default
ALERT=90
# Exclude list of unwanted monitoring, if several partions then use "|" to separate the partitions.
# An example: EXCLUDE_LIST="/dev/hdd1|/dev/hdc5"
EXCLUDE_LIST="/auto/ripper|loop"
#
#::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#
main_prog() {
while read -r output;
do
  #echo "Working on $output ..."
  usep=$(echo "$output" | awk '{ print $1}' | cut -d'%' -f1)
  partition=$(echo "$output" | awk '{print $2}')
  if [ $usep -ge $ALERT ] ; then
     echo "Running out of space \"$partition ($usep%)\" on server $(hostname), $(date)" | \
     mail -s "Alert: Almost out of disk space $usep% on $partition" "$ADMIN"
  fi
done
}
 
if [ "$EXCLUDE_LIST" != "" ] ; then
  df -H | grep -vE "^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom|${EXCLUDE_LIST}" | awk '{print $5 " " $6}' | main_prog
else
  df -H | grep -vE "^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom" | awk '{print $5 " " $6}' | main_prog
fi
Summing up
I hope this quick Linux and Unix post and script helps someone to monitor their free disk space health and get an email alert before you run out of it. You can also send push notification to your iOS or Android phone using the same method. See the following tutorial for more info:

I noticed that on devices that have very long path in some cases there might be a line break appended to the output and that will in turn create an error when the script is run like:

line 22: [: -ge: unary operator expected

To remove the line break just append ‚Äú-P‚Äù to the ‚Äúdf‚Äù command.

example:
df -HlP

(P) = adds posix compliance to the output.

Errors that occured: df -H
/dev/mapper/volume00-pgvol
50G 31G 19G 62% /localhome/postgresql

with -P
/dev/mapper/volume00-pgvol 50G 31G 19G 62% /localhome/postgresql

Also if you only have one type of filesystem that you need to monitor then add ‚Äú-t ext3‚Äù will only show EXT3 filesystems.

Hope it helps.

Per L

@sorabh harit:
That is because you run a ‚Äúreal‚Äù Bourne shell, which doesn‚Äôt understand the syntax on that line.

Also, there is a fair bit of double code at the end, and use of a function isn‚Äôt really necessary.

I‚Äôve put up a modified version on my site:

there are some issues with this script

‚Äì it won‚Äôt work with non english output from df

change

    grep -vE "^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom"
to

    grep -vE "^Dateisystem|tmpfs|cdrom"
or you could change it to

  grep -vE "^[^/]|tmpfs|cdrom"
to remove all lines not starting with a / which would also remove mounted network shares (sshfs, nfs etc.)

additionally you could change the df command to

  df -hP fuse.sshfs -x nfs
to remove mounted network devices

another problem arises from the use of ‚Äúsh‚Äù instead of bash ‚Äì
it won‚Äôt work ‚Äì
change the first line to

#!/bin/bash
to improve the error reporting you could also add the hostname to the subject line

One reason for ‚Äúinteger expression expected‚Äù-errors is that if ‚Äú$usep‚Äù is empty the test fails. Just test if ‚Äú$usep‚Äù is empty and do nothing if so:

if [ ! ‚Äú$usep‚Äù == ‚Äú‚Äù ] ; then
if [ $usep -ge $ALERT ] ; then
echo ‚ÄúRunning out of space ‚Äú$partition ($usep%)‚Äù on server $(hostname), $(date)‚Äù |
mail -s ‚ÄúAlert: $(hostname) almost out of disk space $usep%‚Äù $ADMIN

to remove non-local drives it would be better so use the ‚Äú-l‚Äù option of df (substitute ‚Äúdf -H‚Äù with ‚Äúdf -lH‚Äù).

Great script, very simple and works like a charm. i have a question tho, could someone help me to make this script to run a gzip command and monitor the pid in order to start another gzip after the first pid ends? Is it possible to do that, well, in scripts all is possible üôÇ

I need to run 2 gzips on differents directories but can‚Äôt run them at the same time since this will eat my cpu and the disk IO will be very high. I need to start one and then the other. Thanks in advance

I need to know the the usage of particular filesystem on 10 days back. Is it possible to use two or more df option in single line? If yes then how can we use twp grep statement in single line? Thanks in advance !!

I used below line:df -H | grep d30 | awk ‚Äò{print $5 ‚Äù ‚Äù $1}‚Äô | main_prog

But it is not sending any email.

`Hi

I need to write a script which finds a Filesystem which is 100% full and then removes the directoriess temp and cache by running the below commands:
rm /export/home/dw_adm/Informatica/PowerCenter8.6.1/server/infa_shared/Cache/*
rm /export/home/dw_adm/Informatica/PowerCenter8.6.1/server/infa_shared/Temp/*
can u plz suggest how to do?

Thanx

I have prepared the below script to find the filesystem which is 100% full and then remove directories from the given path.But while running its giving an error like:syntax error at line 11: `FSU=$‚Äô unexpected.
Please let me know the issue in the script.

Thanks.

#!/bin/ksh

## This script is for deleting temp and cache files from filesystems on DR. Following will be executed:
## 1)The file srwaisobi001data/zsrwaisobietl01/home will be checked for size.
## 2)If the file is FULL ,mail will be triggered to admin team to delete temp and cache files.
## 3)All temp and cache files will be deleted from DR filesystems if the file is FULL.
## 4)The file will be checked for space.
## 5)After the issue is resolved,mail will be sent to the team.
## In case of failure this task can safely be marked as Completed for current run and investigated later.

FSU=$(df -h|grep '/export/home'|awk '{ print $5}'|sed 's/%//g')
echo $FSU
if [ $FSU -eq 100 ]
then
echo "File System is 100% used.Send email to Admin team "
df -h /export/home >space.txt
mailx -s " srwaisobi001data/zsrwaisobietl01/home is full." user@mail.com space.txt
mailx -s " srwaisobi001data/zsrwaisobietl01/home is ok." user@mail.com <space.txt
fi

For HP-UX: use bdf instead of df and mailx instead of mail

#!/bin/sh
bdf | grep '%' | awk '{ print $5 " " $6 }' | while read output;
do
  echo $output
  usep=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $1}' | cut -d'%' -f1  )
  partition=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $2 }' )
  if [ $usep -ge 90 ]; then
    echo "Running out of space "$partition ($usep%)" on $(hostname) as on $(date)" |

On Solaris try bash shell if you are having issue

replace #!/bin/sh with #!/bin/bash

ou are a given an input file serverList.txt and simulated input of disk utilization diskout.txt. You are expected to write an automated script which would have the serverList.txt as input which has the list of IP Addresses of the servers and the simulated output of the disk utilization file diskout.txt as the input file.

The script should process these files and find the IP Addresses which breaches the threshold of 70%.

# set alert level 90% is default
ALERT=90
# Exclude list of unwanted monitoring, if several partions then use "|" to separate the partitions.
# An example: EXCLUDE_LIST="/dev/hdd1|/dev/hdc5"
EXCLUDE_LIST="/auto/ripper"

#::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

function main_prog() {
while read output;

  partition=$(echo $output | awk '{print $2}')
  if [ $usep -ge $ALERT ] ; then
     echo "Running out of space \"$partition ($usep%)\" on server $(hostname), $(date)" | \
     mail -s "Alert: Almost out of disk space $usep%" $ADMIN

done
}

if [ "$EXCLUDE_LIST" != "" ] ; then
  df -H | grep -vE "^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom|${EXCLUDE_LIST}" | awk '{print $5 " " $6}' | main_prog

You need to configure monitoring service such as syssta and ksar.

Very helpful ‚Äì thanks. I found I didn‚Äôt have mail installed on my Debian machine and wanted to use an external SMTP provider anyway, so install msmtp instead. I changed the mail command to the following:

printf "Subject: Disk space warning\n\nAlert: Almost out of disk space on server - $usep%% used" | msmtp -d -a default "$ADMIN"

EXCLUDE_LIST="/dev/sda2"

main_prog() {
while read -r output;
do
  #echo "Working on $output ..."
  usep=$(echo "$output" | awk '{ print $1}' | cut -d'%' -f1)
  partition=$(echo "$output" | awk '{print $2}')
  msgs+=$(echo -e "--- Running space \"$partition ($usep%)\" on server $(hostname) .\r\n")
done
echo $msgs | mail -s "Disk Space on Server $(hostname)" $TO -aFrom:$ADMIN
}

if [ "$EXCLUDE_LIST" != "" ] ; then
  df -H | grep -vE "^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom|${EXCLUDE_LIST}" | awk '{print $5 " " $6}' | main_prog

In #/bin/sh the += is undefined. Similarly echo flags are undefined, too in #/bin/sh. Try using #!/bin/bash and the line should be:

echo "$msgs" | mail -s "Disk Space on Server $(hostname)" $TO -aFrom:$ADMIN
